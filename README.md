# RainfallStatistics
 Rainfall Statistics - Python

Design a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of the 12 months into an array. The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall, and the months with the highest and lowest amounts.  

Extra Challenge: Use 2 parallel arrays, one to store the month names that will be used as part of the input prompt.
